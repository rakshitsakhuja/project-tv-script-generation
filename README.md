# Tv-script-generation
This project generate TV Scripts from Sinfield's Script using LSTM,word Embeddings etc.
## Project Overview

In this project, I defined and trained a LSTM on a text data. The goal of this project is to generate script based upon the Sinfield using word embeddings.The genrated script seems to be intersting conversation
